Observed 1911019 total fragments (1911019 in most recent round)

[2018-09-21 16:02:15.007] [jointLog] [info] Computed 26017 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-09-21 16:02:15.007] [jointLog] [info] Counted 1290287 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-09-21 16:02:15.088] [jointLog] [warning] Only 1290287 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
