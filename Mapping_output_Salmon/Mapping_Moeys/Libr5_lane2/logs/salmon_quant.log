[2018-09-21 16:33:31.415] [jointLog] [info] Computed 25603 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-09-21 16:33:31.415] [jointLog] [info] Counted 3299200 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-09-21 16:33:31.498] [jointLog] [warning] Only 3299200 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
