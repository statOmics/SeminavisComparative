[2018-09-21 16:17:11.375] [jointLog] [info] Computed 28078 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-09-21 16:17:11.375] [jointLog] [info] Counted 3461188 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-09-21 16:17:11.455] [jointLog] [warning] Only 3461188 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
