[2018-09-21 16:05:21.234] [jointLog] [info] Computed 25455 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-09-21 16:05:21.234] [jointLog] [info] Counted 1643697 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-09-21 16:05:21.312] [jointLog] [warning] Only 1643697 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
