[2018-09-21 16:26:19.197] [jointLog] [info] Computed 27314 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-09-21 16:26:19.197] [jointLog] [info] Counted 1715869 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-09-21 16:26:19.277] [jointLog] [warning] Only 1715869 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
