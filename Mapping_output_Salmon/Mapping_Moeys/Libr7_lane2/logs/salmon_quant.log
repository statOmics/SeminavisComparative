Observed 3060889 total fragments (3060889 in most recent round)

[2018-09-21 16:34:40.429] [jointLog] [info] Computed 28671 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-09-21 16:34:40.429] [jointLog] [info] Counted 2342420 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-09-21 16:34:40.508] [jointLog] [warning] Only 2342420 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
