[2018-09-21 16:21:29.855] [jointLog] [info] Computed 26359 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-09-21 16:21:29.855] [jointLog] [info] Counted 1981568 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-09-21 16:21:29.941] [jointLog] [warning] Only 1981568 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
