[2018-09-21 16:17:20.199] [jointLog] [info] Computed 29496 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-09-21 16:17:20.199] [jointLog] [info] Counted 4118668 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-09-21 16:17:20.330] [jointLog] [warning] Only 4118668 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
