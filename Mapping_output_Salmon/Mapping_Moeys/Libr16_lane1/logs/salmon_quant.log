[2018-09-21 15:57:09.749] [jointLog] [info] Counted 1309376 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-09-21 15:57:09.830] [jointLog] [warning] Only 1309376 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
