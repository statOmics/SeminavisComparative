[2018-09-21 16:10:27.872] [jointLog] [info] Computed 29927 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-09-21 16:10:27.872] [jointLog] [info] Counted 3550536 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-09-21 16:10:27.944] [jointLog] [warning] Only 3550536 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
