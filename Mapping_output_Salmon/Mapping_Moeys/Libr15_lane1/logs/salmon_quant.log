[2018-09-21 15:55:59.691] [jointLog] [info] Computed 26230 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-09-21 15:55:59.691] [jointLog] [info] Counted 2620774 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-09-21 15:55:59.769] [jointLog] [warning] Only 2620774 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
