[2018-09-21 16:19:48.302] [jointLog] [info] Counted 2650226 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-09-21 16:19:48.377] [jointLog] [warning] Only 2650226 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
