Observed 2408723 total fragments (2408723 in most recent round)

[2018-09-21 16:22:08.539] [jointLog] [info] Computed 28095 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-09-21 16:22:08.539] [jointLog] [info] Counted 1631389 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-09-21 16:22:08.611] [jointLog] [warning] Only 1631389 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
