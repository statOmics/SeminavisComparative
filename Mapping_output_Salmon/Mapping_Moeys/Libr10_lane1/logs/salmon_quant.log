[2018-09-21 15:51:18.535] [jointLog] [info] Computed 29447 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-09-21 15:51:18.535] [jointLog] [info] Counted 4114309 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-09-21 15:51:18.645] [jointLog] [warning] Only 4114309 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
