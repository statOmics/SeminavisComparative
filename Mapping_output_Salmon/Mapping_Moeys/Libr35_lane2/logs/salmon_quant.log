Observed 4650763 total fragments (4650763 in most recent round)

[2018-09-21 16:32:02.493] [jointLog] [info] Computed 29986 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-09-21 16:32:02.493] [jointLog] [info] Counted 3613664 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-09-21 16:32:02.568] [jointLog] [warning] Only 3613664 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
