[2018-09-21 16:13:51.774] [jointLog] [info] Computed 28486 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-09-21 16:13:51.774] [jointLog] [info] Counted 2645066 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-09-21 16:13:51.850] [jointLog] [warning] Only 2645066 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
