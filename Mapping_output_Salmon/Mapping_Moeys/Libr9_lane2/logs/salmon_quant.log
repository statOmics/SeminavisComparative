[2018-09-21 16:36:44.799] [jointLog] [info] Computed 28773 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-09-21 16:36:44.799] [jointLog] [info] Counted 3772863 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-09-21 16:36:44.883] [jointLog] [warning] Only 3772863 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
