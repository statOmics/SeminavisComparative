[2018-09-21 16:30:08.604] [jointLog] [info] Computed 25244 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-09-21 16:30:08.604] [jointLog] [info] Counted 1327774 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-09-21 16:30:08.681] [jointLog] [warning] Only 1327774 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
