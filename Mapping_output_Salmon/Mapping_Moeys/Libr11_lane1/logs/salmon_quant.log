Observed 4384891 total fragments (4384891 in most recent round)

[2018-09-21 15:52:57.483] [jointLog] [info] Computed 28123 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-09-21 15:52:57.483] [jointLog] [info] Counted 3456699 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-09-21 15:52:57.571] [jointLog] [warning] Only 3456699 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
